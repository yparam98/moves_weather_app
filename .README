### Intro
This is Yathavan's submission for the Junior Software Developer position at Moves Financial.

### Overview
The app will load onto a screen displaying the current weather and a scrollable pane for the next 7 days forecast. Each panel in the 7 days is clickable to launch a modal with additional details.

### Installation
The app source code and binaries for install on **Android** can be found in the Releases section: https://github.com/yparam98/moves_weather_app/releases/tag/2.00

### Notes
* This app was made entirely in React-Native using TypeScript. 
* This is my first time using TypeScript in a project like this so I may not be using TypeScript to it's full potential. 
* All the components were designed to be minimal and modularized as possible to maximize testability of the code. 
* The core requirements are all included as well at 3/4 (TypeScript, Reusable, Error) requirements of the Extra Credit section. 
* All icons used in the application is from [FreePik from FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik). 
* Google Places API is used for getting location coordinates from user input.
* Basic error handling is implemented so that the app will not display any data if API connection disrupted or invalid location entered.
